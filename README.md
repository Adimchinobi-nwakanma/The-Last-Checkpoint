# The-Last-Checkpoint

I really thank God for the previlage to start this carreer path with GOMYCODE since last six months ago, truely it has not been easy learning this skill and for me is a challenge taking 
 me out of comfort zone which am grateful for and I appreciate my instructor for his commitment and patient in taking me through even when it seems not working.
After this six months I can say it an opening to the world of web.development because what i had during this course was an introductory version of this carrer path which I am willing
to strive for improve and personal learning on this journey. 
As my instructor you can tell my ability so far, And I will always need your assistance to walk this path. 
As you know sir,right now there are many things you taught us during this period of learning which I may not be able to do RIGHT NOW and if opportunity is been given I will value staying even till next year for better understanding of this course.
I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND FOR THE HELPS YOU  BE WILLING TO OFFER ME IN THIS CARRER PATH GOING FORWARD.
